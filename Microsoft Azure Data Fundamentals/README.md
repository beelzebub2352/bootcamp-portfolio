### üéØ Purpose of the Document
This workbook is a **Work In Progress (WIP)** completed as part of my **Data Technician training program - Week 5**, focusing on **Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900)** and **Microsoft Fabric**.  
It explores how cloud platforms like Azure and Fabric enable modern data storage, transformation, and analytics at scale.  
The workbook combines theoretical knowledge, practical lab exercises, and a real-world business case (‚ÄúPaws & Whiskers‚Äù) to develop a strong understanding of **cloud-based data ecosystems, compliance, and business intelligence solutions**.
