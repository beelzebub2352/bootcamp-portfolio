# ðŸ“˜ Data Technician Workbook â€“ Week 3 (WIP)

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Document
This workbook is a **Work In Progress (WIP)** created as part of my **Data Technician training program â€“ Week 3**, focusing on **relational databases, SQL fundamentals, and data modeling**.  
It demonstrates my ongoing development in designing and managing databases using **MySQL** and **Microsoft Access**, while applying real-world business scenarios to structure and query relational data effectively.  
This weekâ€™s work expands on earlier data analysis skills by introducing the principles of **database architecture, normalization, and query optimization**.

## ðŸ§  Key Skills
- **Database Design & Planning** â€“ Developing logical and physical models for storing structured data.  
- **Relational Thinking** â€“ Understanding and applying one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.  
- **Data Modeling** â€“ Translating business operations into normalized database schemas.  
- **Data Integrity & Accuracy** â€“ Implementing keys and constraints to maintain consistent and valid records.  
- **Problem Solving** â€“ Using SQL to address real-world use cases like retail inventory, sales, and customer data management.  
- **Analytical Querying** â€“ Writing queries to analyze, filter, and aggregate meaningful insights from data.  
- **Collaboration & Reflection** â€“ Working with peers on SQL practical tasks and refining database concepts through shared learning.

## ðŸ’» Technical Skills
- **Relational Database Concepts** â€“ Applying **primary keys**, **foreign keys**, and relational dependencies.  
- **SQL Query Writing** â€“ Practicing `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `CREATE TABLE` commands.  
- **JOIN Operations** â€“ Using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`, and `SELF JOIN`.  
- **Schema Design** â€“ Defining tables, fields, and data types to reflect real-world entities and relationships.  
- **Normalization** â€“ Reducing redundancy and improving data efficiency through structured table relationships.  
- **Aggregation & Filtering** â€“ Using `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `SUM()`, `WHERE`, and `GROUP BY` for data summaries.  
- **Star Schema Implementation** â€“ Using fact and dimension tables for simplified analytical querying.  
- **Data Definition Language (DDL)** â€“ Creating and modifying database structures.  
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** â€“ Managing and maintaining data integrity through updates and inserts.  
- **Scenario-Based SQL Queries** â€“ Solving tasks using the `world_db` dataset (e.g., demographic analysis, population queries).  
- **Backup & Access Control** â€“ Understanding data security, user roles, and database maintenance essentials.

### ðŸ§¾ Summary
This ongoing workbook represents my progression into **relational database management and SQL development**.  
Through both theoretical and applied exercises, Iâ€™m developing the ability to **design normalized databases**, **write optimized SQL queries**, and **analyze structured data** effectively.  
As this work continues, Iâ€™ll refine my SQL syntax, join logic, and database design capabilities to further strengthen my skills in data architecture and back-end analytics.
