# Bootcamp Portfolio
## MySQL - Relational Databases and Structured Query Language

This workbook showcases my progress and applied learning during the Data Technician training program.


# ðŸ“˜ Data Technician Workbook â€“ Week 3 (WIP)
### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Document
This workbook was created as part of my **Data Technician training program â€“ Week 3**, focusing on **relational databases, data modeling, and SQL querying**.  
It demonstrates my understanding of database design principles, table relationships, and query writing through practical exercises using **MySQL**.
This weekâ€™s work emphasizes **data structuring, normalization, and query-based analysis**, laying the foundation for effective database management and reporting.
